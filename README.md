# book-library

A book Library system where a ​student​ and a ​teacher borrows books. When the copy of the book is no longer in the library, the library returns "book taken". There can be multiple copies of the same book in the library. The books are given in a ​first-come-first-serve ​manner, but when a teacher is requesting for the same book a student is requesting for, the teacher comes first and when a junior student is asking for the same book a senior student is asking for, the senior student comes first.
The Librarian is the Admin.
